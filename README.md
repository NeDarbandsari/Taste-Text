An examination of restaurant reviews using text mining and sentiment analysis techniques is provided by a Jupyter Notebook file in this repository.  I focused on a complete dataset with over 2000 samples and two features which I got from Kaggle in order to build a robust textual text mining model for restaurant reviews. Access to the dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moazeldsokyx/restaurant-reviews.
